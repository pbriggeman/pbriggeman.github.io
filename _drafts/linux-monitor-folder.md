How many times have you wanted to monitor a folder and if there were any changes to that folder you would want to have a desktop notification?  We are so used to notifications on our devices that we would expect this to be a simple task to do on any given operating system.  Sadly, there is no easy way to do this without a lot of extra scaffolding to make the task easier, but luckily we're getting closer to that objective.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
